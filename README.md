# Circuit2DWPF
Toy project for experimenting with PRISM, WPF, Animations, Refactoring and Unit Testing. 

Side menu with two options, Vehicles and Package to showcase paths with Cuadratic BÃ©zier paths for vehicles and circle based ones for packages. 

By implementing functionality it may easily end up in a bunch of code. 

The aim of this project is to break down the parts, to cover with Unit test the very basic logic and to improve the readability while having fun with cool WPF effects.
